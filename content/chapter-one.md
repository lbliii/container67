Terminal 2 of the West Contour spaceport resided in the deadzone between the 9th Circuit and the Zeroes. The port was small and its fling-rings calibrated only for long-distance travel. People who passed through this tiny oasis imported resources, booked exotic (illegal) experiences, and came to visit loved ones either dead or serving prison sentences. Many who came here liked to sit in the observation deck and marvel at the boundary of human existence. 

Ice particles glittered in the backdrop and moved like clouds. Gasses of every color fluttered with the arrival and departure of ships. A loose, micro-atmosphere encased this spaceport—collected over time by the pull of its gravity core. Even more remarkable, perhaps, were the translucent dust jellies that seemed to thrive here. These creatures were among the first complex species discovered surviving space, swimming among dust rings, absorbing ice and nanoparticles for nutrients. They grew at a glacial pace. One larger than a thumb required over 500,000 active years of growth. At least, under normal conditions. Somehow, they found our outposts and flourished among the subsequent accumulated debris. 

Peering outside the concave glass window-lens, a young girl watched dust jellies bigger than her head dance with the stars. She stood on her tippy-toes, leaning, enraptured. She ignored the intercom as it announced her family’s flight. 

**"Come, Minu,"** said her mother. **"We’ll miss our boarding."**

**"We’re gonna miss it anyway,"** the girl replied, her small finger pointing up at the window. The large, multi-containered station beyond her dancing jellies looked in peril. A flash of white heat hit her face; more people began to crowd the window to see.

**"What is that?"**

**"It’s on fire."**

**"Well, I can *see* that. But. What’s that station used for?"**

**"I think it’s one of those old cryo-prisons."**

The prison’s container clusters were separating. Some intact, others utterly falling apart—spilling hundreds of large, white capsules across the black expanse. Loud whirring sounds filled the spaceport as its fling-rings shuttered their apertures. A voice on the intercom announced cancellations across the board. 

More people huddled around the windows. Cryo-prisons were closed systems. Air gapped. They required no human staff. In fact, they were little more than forgotten storage systems once used for saving organic records. Few people knew about them; even fewer had access to walk their halls. 

Little geometric robots with long, thin alloy arms launched from the spaceport’s outer hull to collect any capsules and debris that got too close. 

**"Hate to be one of those fellas,"** said one man, nudging himself through the crowd towards the window. His hair was short and black and damp, slightly matted. He looked incredibly thin and pale. Lips almost purple. The only thing warm about him were his amber-colored eyes.

**"You mean there’s people in those... pills?"** said another, puzzled. 

The pale man nodded. **"For sure. And who knows for how long they’ve been stuck in there. Probably years."**

**"Millennia,"** replied an older woman. **"My grandfather was a warden for this sector. Used to tell me stories about the terrible people kept in those iceboxes." She shook her head. "No great loss if you ask me. Just another expensive mess to clean."** 

The chatter continued among the spectators as the pale man slithered out from the crowd. His clothes were stark white, punctuated by a pair of oversized government boots and jacket. The pale man lingered in the corridor, scanning the signs along the walls. He felt terribly hungry. Surely, this spaceport had some grub somewhere. 

Down the way and to the left, he found a small kiosk with food holograms floating above a very bored looking teenage girl. He gave her a slight nod and eyed the menu. 

**"What is a PBP?"** he asked.

**"Post-beyond patty,"** she stated, without looking up from the panel behind the counter. 

**"And that is…"**

She sighed. **"It’s an isolated meta-protein pseudo-berg with about 7% fat woven through the fibres."** The girl pointed to the sides. **"Great with orbit fries and… well, usually a fresh cloroblast. But since you look dead tired I’d say swap that for a javagulp."**

**"Ok."** He blinked. **"I’ll take that."**

**"Iced? The javagulp?"**

**"No,"** he chuckled, eyes wide. The man shook his head. **"Make that a hot one, please."**

He didn’t see her actually do anything, but the kiosk itself hummed to life. The side-panel opened to reveal a printer stitching together pink goo and dropping cream-colored crescents into a rapid-heating ovenette. The man smiled, watching the robotic architect build his meal. If nothing else in this place felt familiar, he at least recognized the smell of a burger and fries. For a moment, he forgot that he was in the middle of fleeing for his life. 

**"That’ll be 17,000N."**

The pale man searched his dusty, oversized government jacket and produced a triangular card which, once tapped, snapped into a wristband. He put it on and its surface blinked into a display. The man thumbed through its menus a few times before pushing an authentication request in the girl’s general direction. 

**"Sorry, but, it says your wallet needs an update." She squinted at the screen, moving closer in disbelief. "Quite a lot of them, actually. This version is waaay before— "**

He sighed. **"Ever heard of the v-bug?"**

She shook her head. 

**"It’s a versioning attack on wallets that downgrades the firmware—or at least makes it behave that way—to isolate an account for extraction."**

**"Ookay…"**

**"I got targeted for theft? basically?"** He scratched his head, embarrassed and a little uncertain if the lie would work. 

**"Y’now, my boyfriend’s mother actually had something kinda similar happen to her in the Circ-3 bazaar a few years ago."**

He leaned on the kiosk, eyebrows raised. **"Really?"**

**"No. *Well…*"** Her head bobbled in thought. **"Not *really*."** She pushed the now-finished tray toward him. **"But I can see you’re having a real shit day, sir. And this food isn’t really worth 17,000N."** 

The pale man thanked her profusely and scurried off to a more private corner of the spaceport to scarf down his meal. Thinking of his next move proved impossible with such gnawing emptiness inside him—and with the fling-rings utterly shut down, there was nothing better to do. Thankfully, no-one even had the imagination to consider that one of the cryos had awoken and survived the malfunction of container 67. Much less be the cause of it.

He shivered, clasping the javagulp with bone-white fingers, as he sat on the floor opposite a large board filled with flight delay timers. The reason that marqueed above the departures stated:

 `TRAVEL INTERRUPTION NOTICE: debris from malfunctioning prison station. Approx. 4-8 hours to clear.` 

Evidently, according to the newscaster on the second screen, old prison malfunctions did happen, though they were incredibly uncommon. The pale man bit into his spongey, steaming PBP and twitched at the taste. It tasted... remarkably good. Juicy. He felt the warmth crash into his belly as he swallowed. 

Half an hour later, the reporter returned to the screen with an urgent update: there were two confirmed casualties in the prison malfunction, both known criminals in association with the Woolong syndicate. 

**"The Woolong crime organization is suspected to be responsible in part for the epidemic outbreak in Circ-2’s System 24."** The man sat up, holding his breath. **"We have reason to believe they broke into the cryo-prison in search of a former bio-terrorist, housed in container 67. His remains have yet been found."**

*Fuck*, he thought. *It’s time to go.*
