A small ship blinked into range of the West Contour spaceport with two passengers inside: Zeke Ward and Edda Quor’row. 

**"What a proper mess this is,"** Zeke said, ruffling his mop of curly blonde hair.

Edda, his partner, agreed. **"Sure is. But we’re not here to clean it up this time, Ward. We’re just here to figure out what the fuck happened."**

The pair belonged to a federation called GUARANTOR.8, which looked after the 8 active circuits of space. G.8 members were tasked with navigating incredibly complex inter-planetary, inter-system, and inter-circuit snafus. Historically, the organization’s success rate was questionable—however, most political leaders agreed it best to have G.8 remain active, rather than allow for other rogue parties to run amuck completely unchecked. 

**"Right,"** groaned Zeke, skeptically. 

Zeke and Edda boarded the spaceport and began interviewing the staff in routine fashion. Everyone said the same thing: they had no idea what caused the explosion; they had not seen anyone suspicious roaming the spaceport; they had never seen the two Woolong syndicate members suspected of causing the whole incident. 

The cameras also revealed nothing helpful and were obviously tampered with. Woolongs were always hard to catch; they knew more about the tech that powered our worlds than anyone else alive. Rumors floated about the circuits that the Woolongs traced their lineage through the ages, all the way back to the founding members of those legendary corporations which founded the 9th circuit. Whether or not it was true, the Woolongs certainly always seemed to have the advantage. Especially way out here on their supposed home turf.

**"Alright, I’mma say it,"** Edda said, **"I don’t like circ-9 folks."**

**"Me either. It’s wild out here. Also, I’ve got no leads."** Zeke passed her a tray of moon fries he’d picked up from the HoloYum kiosk and they went to find a seat in the spaceport’s lobby. It was time to compare notes. 

**"Same,"** Edda said, accepting the tray. **"Let’s run another search on the footage we did find. Maybe we need to zoom out here."** Edda tapped the tabletop they were sitting at and it illuminated into a screen which paired with her G.kit opticals. She filtered out all footage with low-to-no passenger movement and then began to check all of the collected datapoints: average passenger height, weight, age, gait, heartbeat, body temp, expressions, features—**"wait."**

**"What is it?"** mumbled Zeke, his mouth full of moon fries.

**"The dataset on passenger body temps. It’s got an outlier  signature which wasn’t collected until after the explosion."**

Zeke nodded. **"Alright, but wouldn’t a spike in body temperature be expected from a bunch of folks who just witnessed the guts of a relic prison system spew out all over their spaceport?"**

**"This one’s registering at 10 degrees colder."** She flashed the data at Zeke. **"But I’m not sure how to map that datapoint to a passenger ID. We need to see the footage associated to that biometric."**

Zeek pushed his tray aside and leaned in. **"Here, let me try."** He then proceed to thumb through several panes, loading various scripts to test the security of the analytics software. **"It looks like when the Woolongs tampered with the system, they forgot to close the exploit they used to get in."**

**"There we go,"** Edda said with a smile, as passenger ID 017123n revealed itself, along with a series of three video logs. She prompted the second one to play. The still was an image of a man, his back towards the camera, standing in front of the very same HoloYum kiosk Zeke had visited just moments before. **"Odd clothing on that man, isn’t it? I haven’t seen anything like that jacket, and I’m pretty sure it’s part of a uniform."**

Edda took note of the patches and serial numbers that were embroidered on the man’s jacket. Maybe those details would prove useful later.

**"Damn,"** Zeke blurted, forgetting himself. **"That guy is hot. Can we zoom in?"**

Edda rolled her eyes. **"Looks about your age, too."** She zoomed in and paused the video to catch the man’s profile. 

Zeke nodded, **"Yeah, looks it don’t it?"**

Zeke was notorious for having an utterly chaotic love life. If Edda were honest, she found it a bit sad. He seemed to love the damaged ones. It was the "thrill and mystery" they represented, she supposed. Or the impossibility of it all. People in their line of work were drawn to fatality—herself included.

**"You realize he’s our primary suspect, don’t you?"**

Zeke shrugged, **"Doesn’t mean he’s guilty of anything. Just suspicious."**

Edda rolled her eyes and proceeded to pull up the encrypted prison log data associated with the missing bio-terrorist. Although they did not have the tools—or the capability—to decrypt the full file, it’s summarization included a brief description of the man it concerned: black hair, golden eyes, 28 years old at the time of freezing. Extremely dangerous. The freeze date, origin planet, and more juicy details were locked.

**"Okay,"** Zeke conceded. **"Still hot though."**

They both laughed.

**"Zeke,"** Edda began, **"This last log entry is from less than two minutes ago."** She looked into his dark, gray eyes. **"I think he’s…heading for a trash scuttler? Shit. It’s nearby. Gate T-135."**

The pair abandoned their half-eaten trays of moon fries and rushed down the the hallway, weaving through the confused mass of stranded passengers, until they came to the gate’s neglected foyer.
This was a service gate; only robots and androids had access. Except, apparently, for their suspect—who had apparently been permitted by the gate attendant to pass. 

**"And why is this gate still operational?"** Edda asked, straining to catch her breath. **"We need to get through. That man isn’t allowed to leave this spaceport."**

The rusty attendant clicked nervously at the confrontation, its eyes knocking loosely from side to side. **"This gate is closed. Human passengers are not permitted to proceed through at this time."**

**"What!?"** Zeke shouted, confused. **"But you let that man through, right there!"** He pointed furiously. 

The attendant clicked again, its neck extending several notches as it strained to see the man they had been referring to. **"I see no man."**

**"Right there, you stupid machine!"** Zeke shouted, again.

Edda drew her blastol from its holster. **"Attendant, we’re going after him."**

The attendant’s demeanor shifted into a still certainty. **"You are not permitted to proceed through gate T-135. This gate is locked down for 48 hours."**

A low buzzing could be heard from beyond the gate’s mouth as, one by one, its defenses sprang to life: magnetic floor panels, force fields, solid vaulted doors. It seemed as though even the gravity in the foyer had strengthened. 

Edda glared at the attendant in stunned silence. They both knew she did not really have any authority out there. Circ-9 was lawless. Perhaps even more than the Zeroes.  But why did this robot allow their suspect passage through a service gate, during a terminal-wide closure no less? It didn’t make any sense. 

**"Conflab?"** Zeke asked, with an annoyingly energetic bounce in his voice.

Edda Nodded. **"Conflab."**
