A red light flickered on the dashboard of a doughnut-shaped  console floating in the middle of a space-black room. The console light progressed to yellow, and then green, before blinking at a steady cadence. The surrounding machinery hummed as it warmed up billions of laser projectiles, cameras, and audio tech. 

This place was once known as The Hexahedrone;  a colossal six-faced auditorium used for performances of all kinds — *the* crown jewel of the 9th circuit’s once titanic entertainment enterprise. There were no ceilings, just rows upon endless rows of seats neatly held in place by a touch artificial gravity and a stroke of genius engineering.  

Today, the Hexahedrone was little more than a lost relic drifting about one of the most desolate quadrants of the dead circuit. It was here the Woolong ambassadors met—remotely—to conspire.
A bright and massive platform, thinner than foil, was unfurling beneath the floating console. It came, seemingly, from nowhere at all—as if someone had taken a particle of light and stretched it one mile this way and that. 

A voice echoed through the empty chamber. **“I think we’ve found someone useful, finally.”**

 An android with cloudy eyes stepped onto the platform. And then five more just like it did the same.  
**“The resource’s name is Nel. An inside man, employed by Biolympus, no less.”**

Another android waved its hand. **“We’ve heard this before. The likelihood of finding an organic resource from the correct era that actually knows—“**

**“7,047 years since this one was frozen.”**

**“Is that so?”** commented one.

**“Origin?”** asked another.

**“Planet Crichton.”**

The room fell silent. Each party had begun their own calculations, attempting to determine the probability that this bio-terrorist was, in fact, the secret key to their success—to the reclaimation and restoration of the 9th circuit, and all its powerful treasures. 

The android leading the meeting presented a series of digital files. Included among those files were the same video logs and encrypted prison manifest Zeke and Edda had collected from the spaceport. 
**“Guarantors are investigating the incident, though they should be of little concern. Our real challenge is catching him.”**

**“How do you suppose?”**

**“We don’t know what he knows. Nor what he has access to. We underestimated his extraction from the prison. Gravely.”**

**“Well, what if we let the Guarantors catch him for us?”**

The others mumbled in agreement. 

**“They certainly won’t kill him. It is not their way…”**

**“True,”** the leader said, **“but there will be others, if he is found out.”**

**“And where is this resource now?”**

**“Aboard a refuse unit that has locked coordinates onto a WIS Satellite station, 36 parsecs deeper into the circuit than we have access to today.”**

They all laughed. 

**“Well,”** said one,  **“let’s change that.”**
