The 9th Circuit of space was, by far, the most desolate. Even beyond it, among the Zeroes, people thrived as bounty hunters, miners, hermits, and thieves. That’s not to say that the 9th was without habitable planets or viable suns—in such terms, in fact, it was most abundant. Relics of mankind beyond collective recollection cluttered the 9th Circuit. Nearly every moon had a base; every planet, special projects which had either launched certain careers or ended them. A golden era of private industry lived and died there.

In that time, there were 3 terraforming superpowers: Vive, Xpanse, and the largest, Biolympus. Each had an army of scientists and robotics which, like seeds of a dandelion, blew across the stars in frantic search to claim the most precious systems for their enterprise. 

The people of that time, as we understand it, divested governments of their traditional powers; instead, they decided upon a threshold for corporations to earn their own sovereignty. For in those days all the strength and wealth of nations did not sit in reserves filled with gold, but in the net-worth of their titanic children.

*"Unhindered progress will not only save humanity, but take us to the farthest reaches of space."* 

These words were spoken in a spirit of pragmatism. No longer would the political realm pretend to be anything other than a direct hand of the elite; social ideologies became living brands, supported by their consumers.

Almost overnight, the laws of System One buckled beneath the promises of tomorrow.

What *exactly* happened during that era is uncertain. Each corporation recorded their own private annals of history—crowdsourced by their subscribers. Distorted by them, as well. Few of these records are accessible. Contemporary decryption technology is, to put it bluntly, primitive in comparison. What we *can* say is that, after a certain point of immense progress, a silent and sharp contraction event occurred. Likely at the height of the 9th circuit’s formation. 

Knowledge was private. Technology, private. A war of information—of data—cleaved humanity from its omnipotence. 

Governments slowly returned to stabilize the planetary network. Today, 8 circuits define the borders of polite civilization; the Zeroes are for everyone else. Mankind has learned to live among the many heirlooms of its advanced ancestors as mere end users. 

*"It just works."* 

Like gravity.
